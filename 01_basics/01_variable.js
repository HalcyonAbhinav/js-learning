const accountId = 12345 // constant ko declare krne ka ek hi trikha h jo ki h const varName


//variable ko declare krne k do trike hai - let and var

let accountEmail = "abhi@gmail.com" 

var accountPassword = "1111"

accountCity = "Lucknow"

// accountId = 54321 (comment lines are not executed)


accountEmail = "sagar@gmail.com"

accountPassword = "2222"

accountCity = "Bengaluru"




// console.log(accountId);

console.table([accountEmail,accountPassword,accountCity])


{

    //This is scope (you will find in many thing )

}

//var does have control on scopes-
//  So prefer not to use var becauze of issue in block scope and functional scope


/*

This is not good practice 
e.g-> accountState = true;
