1-There is not more difference between .js file and .txt both are treated as the source code 
2-.js k andr bhi kuch txt likha h or .txt k andr bhi kuch text likha h but 
e.g if we write console.log("Abhinav") in js 
and console.log(":Abhinav") in .txt so the diff between both of them is konsi file hum kisi software m inject krwake use execute krwa skte  h,
there are lot of software like compiler , interpreter and they have the capability of understanding the syntax like first software will check
what is the type of the extension used and then it will trwat the source code in that way like it will treat console.log that should be treated 
in js 

4-What happens in js is that jo software tha wo hidden tha browser k andr ( so jo bhot se tutoprials m dikhega like first you create index.html 
file, then add script to that and then make a js file and then execute it ), but what happen later that jo software tha bowser m hidden use nikalke
alg krdiya gya or kha key ab jisko standalone javascript execute krna h like we execute our python, java, cpp files  so we can execute the same way
js also , and isse si kaafi saari cheezein or addup hogyi like ab js sirf browser lamguage or frontend language mnhi rh gyi ab js backend , bhi use hoti h ,
mobile m bhi use hoti h and alnost sbhi jgh use hoti hai.So thats is the reason uske ane ka.

5- Like we install environments for java, cpp and there are also for javascript also so ab hume iindex file bnake wha poe js sikkhen k need nhi h or
what mosy people does that  inspect m jayeg and then console m jayenge then then then no need.


6-We have one environment node js and it is not like key browser m jo hmesha software ata tha wo node js hi ata tha alg alg type key execution engine they
like v8 engine and many different names also .

7-There is one environment more also that is deno js



Questions arrive in my mind-

1-I want to ask something that node js is a software  where Javascript can run and earlier before node js the software was hidden inside the browser so what 
that software called?

2-How node js is diff from deno?And why it is need although the node has come?
